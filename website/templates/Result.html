    <h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">Terry's Nail</h1>
    <br/>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Terry's nail is a nail disorder characterized by a white or light pink band at the tip of the nail, while the rest of the nail appears dark or opaque. The condition is named after Dr. Richard Terry, who first described it. Terry's nail can be associated with several underlying health conditions, such as liver disease, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and diabetes. It is believed to be caused by a reduction in blood flow to the nail bed, leading to changes in nail color and appearance.

    <br/>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Koilonychia, also known as spoon nails, is a condition where the nails become thin, soft, and concave, resembling a spoon's shape. The central part of the nail bed sinks inward, while the edges are raised. Koilonychia can be a sign of iron deficiency anemia or other underlying health conditions. It can also be caused by repeated exposure to chemicals, trauma to the nail, or a genetic predisposition.

    <br/>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Clubbing refers to the enlargement and rounding of the fingertips and nails. The nails may curve downward and the nail base may appear swollen. This condition is often associated with various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, such as lung cancer, chronic lung infections, congenital heart defects, and other conditions that reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood. Clubbing is thought to result from increased blood flow to the fingertips and changes in the connective tissue around the nails.

    <br/>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a type of skin cancer that appears on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. It is the most common type of melanoma in people with darker skin. ALM often starts as a dark streak or band on the nail, which may be mistaken for a benign condition initially. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for a better prognosis.

    <br/>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Nail pitting is a condition characterized by the presence of small depressions or pits on the surface of the nails. It is commonly associated with psoriasis, an autoimmune skin disorder. The pitting occurs due to abnormal keratinization in the nail matrix, leading to irregular nail growth. Other conditions that can cause nail pitting include eczema, alopecia areata, and reactive arthritis.

    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Onychogryphosis, also known as ram's horn nails, is a nail disorder where the nails become thickened, elongated, and excessively curved, resembling a ram's horn. This condition is often caused by long-term neglect and lack of proper nail care, leading to overgrowth and distortion of the nail. Onychogryphosis is commonly observed in older adults and individuals with limited mobility.

    <h3 style="font-weight: 500;">Bluish nails, also called blue nails or cyanosis, refer to the bluish discoloration of the nails. This condition is caused by reduced oxygen levels in the blood, leading to poor circulation and oxygenation of the nails. Bluish nails can be a symptom of various underlying health issues, including respiratory problems, circulatory disorders, and congenital heart defects.
